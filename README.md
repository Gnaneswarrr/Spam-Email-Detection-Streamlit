# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning and Streamlit

This project detects spam emails using Machine Learning techniques and provides
a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

## Project Overview
Spam emails are unwanted messages that cause inconvenience and security risks.
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to
classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- NLP
- Streamlit
- Google Colab

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Spam vs Ham classification
- Real-time email checking using Streamlit
- Model training and prediction

## Files in this Repository
- `app.py` – Streamlit application
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for training
- `Spam_Email_Detection.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook
- `spam_model.pkl` – Trained model file

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries
2. Run `app.py` using Streamlit
3. Enter email text to check spam

## Output
